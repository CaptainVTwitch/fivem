[FiveM](https://fivem.net/) is a dual-purpose (SP/MP) modification framework for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V as released by Rockstar Games.

On the multiplayer aspect, it differs from other similar modifications by utilizing the embedded game networking frameworks, building a modification framework around them, and expanding the game's functionality on an end-to-end level, directly binding to the RAGE Technology Group's base frameworks and Rockstar North's GTA codebase.
